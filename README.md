A website which explores communication design's (and design at large) relationship with The Document.
The Document here refers to the bureaucratic artefacts of states, institutions and all forms of authority.
Think of passports, rental agreements, currency and receipts.
A suit of tools is hosted on this website free for anyone to use.
Please fee free to tinker with them, muck around, download or fork, break and reassemble.
