                <p>How can one play with their rental agreement?</p>
                <p>The Document is designed to reside outside of time and politics. The Document is often presented as an
                    immutable projection of authority. It's banal triviality disguising the violence and control that it is
                    designed to legitimise.</p>
                <p>My rental agreement sits-perfectly dust-free and unopened-in my downloads folder. Yet the clauses it
                    contains retain at best an ambient, and at worst a direct and evicting control over the daily decisions of life as a renter.</p>
                <p>This project aims to subvert the enforced displacement of The Document's politicality- make poems with your
                    pay-slip. It aims to counter The Document's imperial language by remixing it and in doing so, obviates the
                    primacy of officiation and obfuscation within its design.</p>
                <p>Throughout this website are sketches and tools I have designed and coded (with the assistance of Copilot) in
                    order to explore this project's aims and the resulting aesthetic/s which emerge.</p>
                <p>The Document is malleable.</p>
                <p>The Technics:<br>What is the methodology of all these tools? The user is asked to upload a pdf document. 
                    It could be anything, as long as it contains text. Then the pdf's text content is extracted including it's strings 
                    of characters and position coordinates relative to the page. The string is then further extracted and sorted into
                    nouns, verbs, adverb and adjectives. These extracted and sorted terms are then placed into randomised layouts
                    which form stickers, or emulations of the pdf's original layout in order to generate books. In performing these
                    transformations The Document is engaged in a frivolous, iterative, playful manner. The architecture of authority
                    is rendered strangeâ€“recomposed as fragments of poetic possibility.
                </p>
                <p>I encourage anyone and everyone to play with these tools, download them, re-purpose them, break them, fork
                    them.</p>
