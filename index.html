I would like to give my sincere thanks to these works and their authors.

How can one play with their rental agreement?

The Document is designed to reside outside of time and politics. The Document is often presented as an immutable projection of authority. It's banal triviality disguising the violence and control that it is designed to legitimize.

My rental agreement sits-perfectly dust-free and unopened-in my downloads folder. Yet the clauses it contains retain an ambient control over the daily decisions of life as a renter.

This project aims to subvert the enforced displacement of the Document's politicality- make poems with your pay-slip. It aims to counter the Document's imperial language by remixing it and in doing so, obviates the primacy of officiation and obfuscation within such language design.

Throughout this website are sketches and tools I have designed and coded in order to explore this project's aims and the resulting aesthetic/s which emerge.

The Document is malleable.

I encourage anyone and everyone to play with these tools, download them, re-purpose them, break them, fork them.</div>
