                <p>How can one play with their rental agreement?</p>
                <p>The Document is designed to reside outside of time and politics. The Document is often presented as an
                    immutable projection of authority. It's banal triviality disguising the violence and control that it is
                    designed to legitimize.</p>
                <p>My rental agreement sits-perfectly dust-free and unopened-in my downloads folder. Yet the clauses it
                    contains retain an ambient control over the daily decisions of life as a renter.</p>
                <p>This project aims to subvert the enforced displacement of the Document's politicality- make poems with your
                    pay-slip. It aims to counter the Document's imperial language by remixing it and in doing so, obviates the
                    primacy of officiation and obfuscation within its design.</p>
                <p>Throughout this website are sketches and tools I have designed and coded (with the assistance of Copilot) in
                    order to explore this project's aims and the resulting aesthetic/s which emerge.</p>
                <p>The Document is malleable.</p>
                <p>I encourage anyone and everyone to play with these tools, download them, re-purpose them, break them, fork
                    them.</p>
